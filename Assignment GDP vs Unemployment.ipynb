    "#### After visual inspection of the graph above we can indeed conclude there is a correlation between the Unemployment rate and development of GDP, as expected. After a sharp drop in GDP growhth, such as in the years 1990, 2001 and 2009, you can see a stark increase in unemployment rate with a delay of +/- 1 year. For 2020 there is no GDP data available yet, however one can suspect the GDP will be lower than 2019 due to the Corona crisis. Subsequently we can see a sharp increase in unemployment rate to 8.4% of the working population in 2020. The reverse is also true, if there are longertime of GDP growth the unemployments tends to lower over time. We can see this in the periods 1991 - 2000 and 2010 - 2018.\n",
